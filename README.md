# Broken News
A game about a boy running a newspaper route on his unicycle and dodging traffic due to lackluster cycling infrastructure.

 This game is a jam entry for LUDUM DARE 53 2023 using Unity 2021.3.24f1

 ### Interesting technical notes:
 * Difficulty had to be adjusted after playtesting to ensure the average player could reasonably play the game.
 * Difficulty ramps up over time to give the player a chance to get a handle on the game and its controls.
 * The street and houses scrolling by in the background is just a single stretch looping seamlessly.
 * Obstacles and vehicles spawn just off the right-side of the screen and despawn as they pass of the left.
 * The traffic coming behind the player moves faster to catch up with the player and pose a threat while the oncomming traffic is slower to be possible to avoid and balance the difficulty.
 * Vehicles have a chance to decide to be commit a hit-and-run by just flooring it after making contact with anything and if a car's wheels leave the ground they will take off like a rocketship to add to a crazy and chaotic atmosphere.
 * There is an extremely rare chance you'll see a dog driving a golf cart.
